        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
            <li>3/4 cup distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 bulb garlic, peeled and crushed</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine chicken, vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, peppercorns, garlic, and bay leaves in a Dutch oven; bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, basting chicken occasionally with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid and continue to simmer until liquid has reduced by half, 5 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a serving plate. Strain liquid from the pot to remove bay leaves and other solids.</li>
            <li>Serve chicken hot and drizzle with strained sauce.</li>
