        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Juicy adobo steak marinated in spicy chipotle chile sauce. Perfect for those who are looking to spice things up by trying other meats other than the traditional chicken.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 medium lime, juiced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of finely chopped canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons adobo sauce, or to taste</li>
            <li>4 (8 ounce) beef sirloin steaks</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Whisk lime juice, garlic, oregano, and cumin together in a small bowl. Stir in adobo peppers and adobo sauce.</li>
            <li>Pierce steaks on both sides with a sharp knife; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place steaks into a glass baking dish. Pour adobo marinade over top; turn steaks until well coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove steaks from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Grill steaks on the preheated grill for 6 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium.</li>
        </ol>
